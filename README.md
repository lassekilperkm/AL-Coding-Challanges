# Hacker Language
Create a function which takes a text parameter as input and converts the text to hacker language!

The hacker language uses numbers instead of aplha chars, for example:

"AL is cool!" -> "4L 1s c00l"

The following characters have to be changed to be representated by numbers:
'a' -> '4'

'e' -> '3'

'i' -> '1'

'o' -> '0'

's' -> '5'

## In AL...
Create a page which has a field as input and another field as the output, which displays the converted text.

## Bonus
Maybe there are more characters which can be replaced, use your 1m4g1n4710n!

## Challange yourself!
Try to solve the challange on your own, if you struggle you can always have a look in my example solution.
