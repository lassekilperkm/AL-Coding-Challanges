# FizzBuzz
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz".

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...

The explanation above is taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#:~:text=Fizz%20buzz%20is%20a%20group,with%20the%20word%20%22fizzbuzz%22.)

## In AL...
Create a list page which displays each correct output ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz" or the number if not divisable) for each number between 1 and 100.

## Bonus
if you are done and happy with your result, try to add a new rule for numbers divisable by 7. Those numbers should produce the output "Fuzz" and, if possible, combinations like "FizzFuzz", "FuzzBuzz" like before.
