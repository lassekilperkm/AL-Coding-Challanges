# Longest Word
The challange is to find the longest english word possible, which can be displayed in a [seven-segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display).

Not every character of the alphabet can be rendered by such a display. Therefore we have to exclude some of them:
1. 'g'
2. 'k'
3. 'm'
4. 'q'
5. 'v'
6. 'w'
7. 'x'
8. 'z'

You can find a collection of english words on [github](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt).
For processing this list I would recommend using the raw file.

## In AL...
Create a new page which displays the longest word from the list, which meets the criteria (excluded characters).

## Bonus
If you are happy with your solution, try to also exclude the characters 'i' and 'o', these could be interpreted as '1' and '0' which could cause some confusion.

## Challange yourself!
Try to solve the challange on your own, if you struggle you can always have a look in my example solution.
